				<p>Hello, my name is Johan Cristobal (he/him), a fifth-year graduate student in the Mathematics Department at University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), pursuing a doctorate degree in Mathematics! I am finishing my dissertation in Mathematics Education this May 2025! I advanced to Candidacy in Fall 2023! üéâ I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the chaotic year of 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics of Computation. I received my Master's of Science in Mathematics from UNL in December 2021! üéâüéâüéâ</p>

				<p><b>A little autobiography:</b> I was born near Manila, Philippines and grew up there until I was nine. My entire family relocated to the United States in 2007 and since then I have moved more times than I would've liked. I have lived in about 14 different places now, Lincoln being the 14th place. Though it's sad to move away from friends, I am lucky to have been able to experience different things. I learned that I'm not the best in the cold, so living in Nebraska has been an immense challenge, physically and mentally.</p>

					In <font color= "red">math</font>, I like differential equations and education. In my time in grad school, I've found that there's a non-empty intersection between differential equations and machine learning. Whenever I get around to research, that is where I'll be. Education has always been at the forefront of my motivation, and I would love to research the effects of virtual classrooms on the motivation of students and community building aspects that were natural to in-person teaching.

					In <font color = "blue">the arts</font>, I like to create digital art through the Adobe Suite. I can decently use Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro. And I am also currently learning how to use Adobe Dreamweaver and Adobe Audition! I also like music, I dabble in a bit of basic compositions when I get the rare inspiration.

				<p>My main hobbies include playing video games, listening to music, making videos and art, cooking, and other creative things. I also dabble in casual writing essays and poetry, which you can check out in <a href="/writings" target="_blank"><b>Writings</b></a>. I also have a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/johanmode"><b>Youtube channel</b></a> and below this page are some videos I made that I like a lot.</p>

					In <font color = "#0E8606">other sciences</font>, I like computer science, but I lean more on the theoretical side of things. But don't be fooled, I can proficiently code in C/C++, while being vaguely efficient in Python and LISP. I also like Physics, mainly the basic stuff because I spent a year facilitating discussions and sections for an introductory Physics class.
